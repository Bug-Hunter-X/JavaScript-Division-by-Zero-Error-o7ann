# JavaScript Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains a function that does not handle cases where the divisor is zero, resulting in an error. The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to handle this error gracefully. 

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`.
3. Run the code. You will see an error in the console.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows a more robust solution that handles division by zero by checking the divisor and returning an appropriate value or throwing a user-friendly exception.
